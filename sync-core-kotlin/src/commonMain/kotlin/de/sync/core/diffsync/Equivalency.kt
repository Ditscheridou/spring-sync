/**
 * Strategy interface for determining if two objects are equivalent.

 *
 * During the course of a patch, a resource entity may have its properties change, thus rendering it
 * unequal to another unchanged instance of the same resource entity. Yet, for the purposes of the
 * differential synchronization algorithm, it's important to know if two entity objects are equivalent.
 * That is, it's important to know if two objects are considered to represent the same resource, even
 * if their properties are different.
